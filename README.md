NSBLPA Prototype - README
This document contains the README for the NSBLPA Prototype website. It includes details about running the prototype locally, assumptions and design decisions, assets used, and a live GitHub Pages preview link.
1. How to Run the Prototype Locally
Option 1: Open Directly in Browser
1. Download or copy the `nsblpa-prototype` folder to your computer.
2. Inside the folder, locate `index.html`.
3. Double-click `index.html` → it will open in your default browser.
4. Use the navigation menu to explore different pages.

👉 That’s it — the prototype runs directly from local files.

2. Assumptions & Design Decisions
- Static Prototype: This project is frontend-only (HTML, CSS, JS) with no backend or database.
- Responsive Layout: The design is responsive and adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Styling: Built with vanilla CSS3, without external frameworks, to keep it lightweight.
- Navigation: Simple static links between pages.
- Accessibility: Text contrast improved, focus styles added.
- Content: Placeholder content used for demo.
3. Assets Used
- Logos & Icons:
   * Stored in assets/images/
   * Social icons (Facebook, X/Twitter, YouTube) from Icons8

- Hero & Highlight Images:
   * Example images (hero-600.webp, highlight1.jpg, etc.)

⚠️ All logos, images, and icons are placeholders only and not official branding.
4. GitHub Pages Live Link
The prototype is live on GitHub Pages:
* https://pmandal1.github.io/nsblpa-prototype/
